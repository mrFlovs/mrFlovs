        <h1><br>Little boy and Big Man is a ROBLOX action platformer. You play as Little Boy, trying to go through the very big and complex obstacle courses! Giant Human, the villain of the story, has set up a giant path for you and your brother, Big Man, to go through. You are tasked by Big Man to go through the path and defeat Giant Human. However, this won't be an easy task, as Giant Human's lackeys will make sure you don't lay a hand on their boss. You have to go through a big metallic obstacle course, even a giant icy cave. Will you face Giant Human at the end of the courses...Or will you miserably fail and lose you and your brother's lives to Giant Human's grubby giant hands? You'll see.</br></h1>
